>## Data flow
In this project, we have four layers-
* **Controller** - The controller layer handles the HTTP requests, translates the JSON parameter to object, and authenticates the request and transfer it to the business (service) layer. In short, it consists of views i.e., frontend part.
* **Service** -The business layer handles all the business logic. It consists of service classes and uses services provided by data access layers.
* **Repository** - This layer mainatains the h2-database thing on which CRUD operations are performed
* **Model** - This layer consists basically the class level things- the various classes required for the project and these classes consists the attributes to be stored.
* **Database Design**
